# House_Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict house prices based on a dataset with numerous features. The model is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy` for data processing and regression analysis.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset with approximately 250 columns and 3000 rows, where the target variable is `'SalePrice'`. The features include various attributes of houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location), and the model employs a regression technique to predict the sale price. The code includes data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values), train-test splitting, and model training.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for modeling.
- Train-test split: Splits the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
- Model training: Implements a regression model to predict house prices.
- Evaluation: Provides metrics to assess model performance (Mean Squared Error).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pandas` (>=1.3.0)
- `numpy` (>=1.21.0)
- `scikit-learn` (>=1.0.0)
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
